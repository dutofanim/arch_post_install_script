### Script for install programs after Arch linux installation.

This script aims to install the packages I use in my installation in an automated way.
To use it you must clone this repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/dutofanim/arch_post_install_script.git
```
 Give the execution permission to the `install.sh` file using the command:
```
chmod +x install.sh
```
With the execute permission, run the command with:
```
./install.sh
```
